# Bingo
Bingo is a popular number-matching game played on a grid—usually 5×5—filled with numbers. The goal is to mark off a pattern of numbers (such as a row, column, or diagonal) and be the first to complete the pattern.

# Bingo with AI
This is a minimum 2-player game. In this project, one Bingo card is for the user and the other is for the AI.

# How It Works

- Each player has a 5×5 card filled with random numbers from 1 to 25.

- Click a number to select it. The selected number will be marked on both cards.The AI will also randomly select and mark a number on both cards.

- The first player to complete five full rows, columns, or diagonals wins the game.
